## GlucoLog: An AI-Powered Diabetic Health Journal 
#### _Enhancing Healthcare's Digital Front Door: Digital solutions to help increase access, manage health, and improve patient satisfaction along the healthcare journey_ 

### Problem Statement & Solution
In the last 20 years, the number of adults with diabetes has more than doubled, with diabetes being labeled as an epidemic growing in the U.S. at an alarming rate by a 2021 Sharp Health News article. We want to make navigating day-to-day health easier for the growing population of people with type 2 diabetes by developing a tailored health experience for self-monitoring that makes personalized care more accessible. Our solution is a personal health journal supplemented by AI-powered health feedback in order to deliver educational and enjoyable patient experiences.

Thus, our solution addresses 2 CORE Themes:
- **Access to Care**: How can we make it easier to access care (especially specialists) and provide clear, timely notifications, and reminders along their healthcare journey?
- **Managing My Health**: It's easy to get overwhelmed by all the tasks patients often have to do to maintain their health, how can we make managing health more enjoyable?

### What is GlucoLog?
GlucoLog is a personal health journal supplemented by AI-powered health information based on daily blood sugar levels and meal entries, delivering an enhanced patient experience. 

Our product’s principal features include:
1. Daily health journal entries with contextualizing AI-powered information 
2. Ability to monitor blood glucose levels, nutrition, symptoms, and add additional notes  
3. Easy access to a history of logged daily journal records at a calendar’s view
4. Export health journal entries as a PDF for patients to take to their doctor's appointments.

### Deliverables
We implement these features through our <a href= "https://dailyglucosejournal.netlify.app/"> website</a>, coded in HTML, CSS, and the JavaScript web framework Svelte. We made use of Google’s Gemini API to power supplementary AI information within daily journal entries. For more insight into our product and its features feel free to check out our 20+ screen interactive prototype designed in <a href= "https://www.figma.com/proto/D13s6Hjw4maD0HI3U2zQPv/Project?node-id=129-179&node-type=frame&t=0Rr8QU4YqYEHmrpO-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=129%3A179/"> Figma</a>.

### What's next for GlucoLog
In the future, we would like to extend our product's functionality by implementing a mobile app in addition to our existing responsive website. We hope that through our product, patients will be empowered to confidently start communicating health results openly and further take ownership of their health journey.
