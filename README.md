## GlucoLog: An AI-Powered Diabetic Health Journal 
#### _Enhancing Healthcare's Digital Front Door: Digital solutions to help increase access, manage health, and improve patient satisfaction along the healthcare journey_ 

### Problem Statement & Solution
We believe that blood glucose is an important diabetes metric that remains relevant. We derive 3 key factors that make this metric impactful—a growing diabetes epidemic, the susceptibility of the elderly, and food insecurity in San Diego.

These factors create barriers that together make navigating day-to-day health for those with type 2 diabetes difficult. We close the gap created by this through development of a tailored health experience that personalizes self-monitoring. 

Thus, our solution addresses 2 CORE Themes:
- **Access to Care**: How can we make it easier to access care (especially specialists) and provide clear, timely notifications, and reminders along their healthcare journey?
- **Managing My Health**: It's easy to get overwhelmed by all the tasks patients often have to do to maintain their health, how can we make managing health more enjoyable?

### What is GlucoLog?
GlucoLog is a mobile personal health journal supplemented by AI-powered health information based on daily blood sugar levels and meal entries, delivering an enhanced patient experience. 

Our app’s principal features include:
1. Daily health journal entries with contextualizing AI-powered information 
2. Ability to monitor blood glucose levels, nutrition, symptoms, and add patient additional notes  
3. Easy access to a history of logged daily journal records at a calendar’s view 

### Deliverables
We implement these features through our <a href= "https://dailyglucosejournal.netlify.app/"> website</a>, coded in HTML, CSS, and the JavaScript web framework Svelte. We made use of Google’s Gemini API to power supplementary AI information within daily journal entries. For more insight into our app and its features feel free to check out our 20+ screen interactive prototype designed in <a href= "https://www.figma.com/proto/D13s6Hjw4maD0HI3U2zQPv/Project?node-id=129-179&node-type=frame&t=0Rr8QU4YqYEHmrpO-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=129%3A179/"> Figma</a>.

### What's next for GlucoLog
In the future, we would like to extend our app’s features by providing an option to print entry history as a pdf for patients to take to their doctor appointments. We hope that through our app, patients will be empowered to confidently start communicating health results openly and further take ownership of their health journey.
